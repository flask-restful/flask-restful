  error handler, to handle 405 Not Allowed errors on requests to Api endpoints.

Version 0.2.0
-------------

Released on April 9, 2013

- Flask-RESTful will no longer clobber your app's error handler; it will only
handle errors that occur while handling Flask-RESTful routes. The breaking
change is that 404 errors will default to using the Flask text/html error
handler. Override this behavior by passing `catch_all_404s=True` to the `Api`
constructor. (via [@yaniv-aknin]( /yaniv-aknin ))
- Arguments can now take `location` as a tuple, in case you want to
specify that an argument could be passed in multiple places. (via
[@mindflayer](/mindflayer))
- Fixes a problem where passing an empty post body to a resource that expected
  a json argument would throw a 500.
- Creation of the `Api` and initialization of the Flask `app` are no longer
  bundled together. (via [@andrew-d](/andrew-d))
- `marshal_with` now works with responses that are tuples. (via
[@noise](/noise))
- `types.url` will no longer throw a ascii decoding ValueError if you pass it
Unicode characters

The first released version of 0.1.6 contained a problem with the tar.gz
