Version 0.2.1
-------------

Released on April 9, 2013

- Use the default Flask-RESTful error handler, instead of the default Flask
  error handler, to handle 405 Not Allowed errors on requests to Api endpoints.

Version 0.2.0
-------------

Released on April 9, 2013

- Flask-RESTful will no longer clobber your app's error handler; it will only
handle errors that occur while handling Flask-RESTful routes. The breaking
change is that 404 errors will default to using the Flask text/html error
handler. Override this behavior by passing `catch_all_404s=True` to the `Api`
constructor. (via [@yaniv-aknin]( /yaniv-aknin ))
- Arguments can now take `location` as a tuple, in case you want to
specify that an argument could be passed in multiple places. (via
[@mindflayer](/mindflayer))
- Fixes a problem where passing an empty post body to a resource that expected
  a json argument would throw a 500.
- Creation of the `Api` and initialization of the Flask `app` are no longer
  bundled together. (via [@andrew-d](/andrew-d))
- `marshal_with` now works with responses that are tuples. (via
[@noise](/noise))
- `types.url` will no longer throw a ascii decoding ValueError if you pass it
Unicode characters

Version 0.1.7
-------------

Released on March 24, 2013

The first released version of 0.1.6 contained a problem with the tar.gz
uploaded to PyPI. 0.1.7 contains the same changes as 0.1.6 but ensures the
version you download from PyPI does not contain problems (if for example, you
cached the old, broken version of 0.1.6).
